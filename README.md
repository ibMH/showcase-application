This repo contains different showcase applications for presenting the features of the mobile robots and the research at the match institute.

# Manual Drive Showcase
The first showcase application allows the user to drive one or multiple mobile robots with a PS4 controller. In the terminal the program shows the user which options there are to control the robots. The first option is to control only one robot by the PS4 controller. The second option is to control multiple robots through a virtual master robot that is placed within one of the real mobile robots.
